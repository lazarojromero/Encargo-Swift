# Encargo-Swift
Encargo is an application that helps organize groups who need help keeping track of items or tasks. Encargo uses Google's Firebase database to update in realtime. A user must create an account or signin if already has one, then that user can add items or tasks like a basic todo list. The user may then add other users to their group in order to see all tasks/items that everyone in their respective group has added to the list. Also, the users can edit the tasks by deleteing or toggling to complete or incomplete. Encargo is a great application to help organize situations like living with roommates or planning a party and splitting the tasks/items needed.
